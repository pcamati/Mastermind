### Rules

1) The game requires two players who will take turns playing as the codemaker and the codebreaker. Thus, the players must play an even number of rounds, decided at the beginning of the game.

2) The codemaker chooses a pattern of four coloured pegs, which cannot be white or black. Following the traditional version, the available colors are red, blue, yellow, green, pink, and purple. Players decide in advance whether duplicates and blanks are allowed.

3) The codemaker places the chosen pattern in the four holes covered by the shield visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker. [this step is not reproduced in the current version]

4) The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the board.


5) Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position. If there are duplicate colors in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same number of duplicate colors in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is red-red-blue-blue and the player guesses red-red-red-blue, the codemaker will award two black key pegs for the two correct reds, nothing for the third red as there is not a third red in the code, and a black key peg for the blue. No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second blue.

6) Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the board are full.

7) Traditionally, players can only earn points when playing as the codemaker. The codemaker gets one point for each guess the codebreaker makes. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker is unable to guess the exact pattern within the given number of turns. (An alternative is to score based on the number of key pegs placed.) [The current code implements the tradidional score system]

8) The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon number of games are played.
